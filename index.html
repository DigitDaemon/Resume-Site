            <p>Hello and welcome to my website.</p>
            <p>I know it is very simple looking, but I hope that you will take the time to look around and learn a little bit about me.</p>
            <br>
            <p>First and foremost , I am an engineer and learner. 
            I enjoy solving problems and learning new things, working with new people, and growing myself.<p>
            <br>
            <p>I have been interested in working in the video game industry since I was five years old after I got my first game console, a Gameboy Color, and Pok√©mon: Yellow Version as a Christmas present. In high school I fell in love with programming and went on to study Computer Science in college. I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Cal Poly Pomona.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I am passionate about algorithms and optomization. I am gameplay focussed and creative as well, with many projects of my own I would like to one day try and develop. I am a strong communicator and team player, with a lot of leadership experience.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I hope you will take the time to visit some of these links and learn more about
            me.</p>
